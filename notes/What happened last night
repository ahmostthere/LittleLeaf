What happened last night
I was about to leave
I was ready to pack my stuff
I was going to go to my parents house for the weekend
Charisse said she doesnt like me at all
I promised that I would not make her cry like I did yesterday
I will not gas light Charisse like I did yesterday
What did I do yesterday?
We were in the car having lunch
I said I was researching Quadtrees 
She asked what for
I said I just wanted to learn it 
I assumed she knew it was for the game
She asked why I was working on that rather than what I said I was working on
I said fine, then I will stop working on the game. I thought she wanted me to work on the game too..
She got sad that I said that and gave her attitude
She was sad I got defensive
She just wanted to talk and know what I was doing
I got too defensive saying that what I was doing was part of programming the game
She said she doesnt like me at all
She doesnt want to play any games with me
Charisse didnt want to play with me last night.
I promised to remember everything.
Why do I keep on forgetting everything..
